            <h4>Description</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                I spent the summer working as an intern for PricewaterhouseCoopers(PwC). I worked as a project lead for a non-profit named CareerVillage. CareerVillage is a website that helps students looking for advice connect with industry experts to answer their career questions. My team and I analyzed several data sheets and spent time on the website to get a better feel for it. From there we recommended a number of improvements to their user interface, data collection, and data utilization in order to improve accessibility, data processing, and overall user experience.

            <h4 >My Role</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
            As pod leader, I both organized and lead our team meetings and project work time.

            <h4 class="subheadings">What I Learned</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Although the project I worked on wasn't closely related to what I'm learning in college, I learned a lot during my time working on it. While I had worked on group projects for school before, I had no experience working in a team in a professional environment. This opportunity allowed me to expand some of my soft skills. My communication, leadership, and conflict-resolution abilities were tested over the course of this project.

                Along with soft skills, I increased my familiarity with Excel and learned Alteryx for data analytics; I also got experience with the data-visualization software Power BI. Having to create an engaging professional slide deck was considerably more challenging than I had expected it to be, but I'm sure these skills will come in handy no matter what career I end up in.
