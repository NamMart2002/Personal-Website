            <br>
            <p>
                In this project, me and group of fellow computer science students created a Point-of-Sale System for a restaurant in one of our school's cafeterias named Pom & Honey.
                The class that we created this project for is designed to emulate real-world software development as closely as possible. 
                We followed the waterfall model for this project's development, so in addition to coding, we spent a great deal of time planning and testing our implementation.

            </p>
            <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            We began by designing a PostgreSQL database to base the rest of our project around. Python was used to fill our sales table in order to generate test data for later development. The rest of our project was built in java, with the front end utilizing Swing to build our GUI.

            <h4 class="subheadings">My Role</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Going into this project, I had originally volunteered to lead the backend development for this project, but due to my having more Java experience I also built a significant amount of our frontend. I was responsible for the majority of our backend logic and a good portion of our GUI's behavior.

            <h4 class="subheadings">What I Learned</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Although I had a lot of Java experience going into this project, I did not have a lot of experience building GUIs in the language. Over the course of this project, I became a lot more familiar with Swing's library. Additionally, I learned how to make SQL queries, but I was by no means an expert at this point.</p>
