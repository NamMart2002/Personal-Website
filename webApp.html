            <p>
                In this project, I worked in the same team as I did on the Java GUI project. We wanted to bring the system online in form the of a Web App, and we wanted to make a few improvements. We wanted to add a self-service portal for customers, improve accessibility, and add a few APIs. 

            </p>
        
            <br>
            <p>
                The only thing that we could keep from our GUI was the PostgreSQL database that we designed; everything else had to be rebuilt from the ground up. Instead of using Java for both the front and back end, our new project was going to be built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Express.js. We'd also go on to implement the Google Translate, Google OAuth, and Google Maps APIs in our Web App.

            <br>
            <p>
                As in our Java GUI, I was placed in charge of our back end. This was definitely much more challenging for me than our GUI, as I had very little experience with JavaScript and absolutely none with Node or Express. I also implemented the Google Translate API in our project to make it more accessible to non-English speakers.

            <h4 class="subheadings">What I Learned</h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Although I wasn't super familiar with JavaScript going into this project, it being C based made it easy for me to pick up. Learning Express was significantly more challenging, but the more I used it the easier it became to use the framework. Eventually, I was able to make post requests, redirect pages, and handle database queries with ease. I spent most of my time on this project working on the back end, but I did end up also learning a decent amount of new tricks for HTML, CSS, and front end development in general from working with one of my group members

                If you'd like to visit our Web App you can find it <a href="https://pomandhoney-r5ro.onrender.com">here</a>, but my university has closed our 
                PostgreSQL database so not everything is functional anymore. 
                If you'd like to see our code please visit our project's <a href="https://github.com/CSCE315-F22-Taele/Team-14-Project_3">repo</a>.
